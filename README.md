This project simulates basic functionalities of the Data Link Layer (Layer 2) of the OSI model.<br>
It is developed in C++ and includes a graphical user interface (GUI).<br><br>

🔧 Features<br>
Select and read .dat files from the file system<br>
Split data into 100-bit frames<br>
Generate 16-bit CRC for each frame<br>
Calculate a checksum based on all CRC blocks<br>
Simulate Stop & Wait flow control<br><br>

Random events:<br>
10% chance of frame loss<br>
20% chance of data corruption<br>
15% chance of ACK loss<br>
5% chance of checksum error<br><br>

Visual representation of sender and receiver activities<br><br>

📁 Build & Run<br>
Can be compiled with any C++ GUI framework.<br>
Compatible with Windows 10 and above.<br><br>

🎓 Purpose<br>
To gain hands-on experience in error detection, flow control, and data integrity through simulation.
